Project: Evil Among Us: Statistical Profiling of Serial Killers

April 2021

Overview

Even though the genre is macabre, murder has plagued human kind for centuries. It has a long history of scaring the masses because serial killers are vague and exist within societies’ underbelly. “How does one become a serial killer or victim?” We are here to weave that story together by using the data of numerous serial killer’s age, gender, location, IQ, killing preferences and economic statuses. “Will I be targeted or the ones I love?” Our group will also explore that with the data on the month, motives, generations, state, and gender that the killer is most likely to do these horrible deeds. There is over a century of serial killer data to answer these questions, we are here to predict the overall victims success and killers downfall!   

Project Scope

We will primarily be exporting data from Ratsford University, a website dedicated to current and historical serial killer stats, and several other resources. We will import the data into Jupyter Notebook and use Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to: 
create, combine and clean dataframes 
run subsets and correlations
create visualizations, tables and other useful outputs

Deliverables

More to come once we look over the data!
