Project: The Real Coin Toss of the NFL

April 2021

Overview
Even though the game is dynamic, sports has a long history of calculated decisions determined by data and we are here to weave that story together. Major corporate and industry stakeholders rely on this data to make crucial and fiscal decisions, some in which make or break careers. Which overall components are the most highly correlated to make the best NFL franchises? Is there a relation between team salaries and their corresponding championship reign/s? Does a draft pick order have a relation to career longevity and success? There is over a century of NFL data to answer these questions and predict overall success.  
Project Scope
We will primarily be exporting data from Pro Football Reference, a website dedicated to current and historical football stats. We will import the data into Jupyter Notebook and use Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to: 
create, combine and clean dataframes 
run subsets and correlations
create visualizations, tables and other useful outputs

Deliverables
More to come once we look over the data!
